# StructIQ
StructIQ AI Engine: GridSmart Infrastructure Monitoring & Fraud-Resilient ReportingStructIQ is a full-stack AI-powered platform designed for city authorities to monitor the health of bridges, roads, and flyovers. It features a citizen reporting portal with an AI fraud-detection layer and a real-time Authority Command Center.🌟 Key FeaturesReal-time Health Monitoring: Assets (Bridges/Roads) decay dynamically based on age and asset type.AI-Powered Reporting: Citizen reports include simulated AI crack detection and fraud prevention (blocks stock/downloaded images).Interactive Command Center: A dark-mode satellite dashboard with live telemetry (vibration analysis) and maintenance controls.Weather Simulation: A "Force Flood" trigger to simulate the impact of Chennai monsoons on road health.Admin Repair System: Authorities can manually boost asset health after completing physical repairs.🚀 Quick Start Guide1. PrerequisitesEnsure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install the required dependencies:Bashpip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy pydantic python-multipart
2. File StructureEnsure your folder looks like this:Plaintextproject-folder/
├── main.py          # FastAPI Backend logic
├── database.py      # SQLAlchemy models & DB config
├── index.html       # Citizen landing page
├── auth.html        # Authority Dashboard
└── database.db      # (Auto-generated) SQLite database
3. Launch the ServerRun the following command in your terminal to start the backend on the required port:Bashuvicorn main:app --reload --port 8080
4. Initialize Demo DataBefore opening the frontend, visit this URL in your browser to load the 9 Chennai landmarks:👉 http://127.0.0.1:8080/setup-demo🔐 Demo CredentialsTo move from the Citizen Portal to the Authority Command Center, use the following credentials in the login modal:FieldValueCommander IDadminAccess Keychennai123🛠️ API Endpoints SummaryMethodEndpointDescriptionGET/assetsFetches all infrastructure data for the map.POST/reports/upload-aiUploads a citizen report with AI fraud check.POST/weather/trigger-floodDrops all "Road" health by 15% immediately.POST/assets/{id}/maintenanceManually restores 20% health to a specific asset.📡 Hardware Simulation (Telemetry)The dashboard includes a Telemetry Scan. By clicking on an asset name (e.g., Napier Bridge), the system generates a live Chart.js vibration graph. This simulates real-time IoT sensors embedded in the concrete to detect structural resonance.⚖️ LicenseThis project is built for the StructIQ Demo and Hackathon purposes. All landmark coordinates are approximate for visualization.
